## Project

* The Austin Homelessness Advisory Committee** ("Advisory Committee" for short) is Austin's first lived experience advisory group for the homeless. It was created to help with the development of research tools, to provide a way to consult with committee members on findings, and to test out possible solutions around the issue of homelessness.
* The Advisory Committee started with a 6-month pilot. The group included 13 members who were or are currently experiencing homelessness. By March 2018, the Advisory Committee had grown to 16 members with a 90% attendance rate for each meeting. The pilot was extended to 18 months.
