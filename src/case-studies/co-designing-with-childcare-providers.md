## Project overview

- The Platform Co-op Development Kit was a project that aimed to build digital tools to help people start, grow, and convert to co-ops. As a part of this project, we did co-design with our partner cooperatives to understand what digital tools they needed.
- This project was in collaboration with the **Platform Cooperative Consortium** at The New School, and involved the co-design of various tools with members in the co-op community and partner organizations, including **CoRise Cooperative**.


### Our partner

CoRise Cooperative is a childcare provider-owned business. It aims to ease providersâ€™ administrative load and create access to new forms of revenue for greater financial security. Childcare providers, despite being a core pillar of our economy, are overworked and underpaid. CoRise wanted to co-design digital tools that would ease the administrative load of childcare providers.

### Desired outcome
- To understand the technology needs of childcare providers
- To build or source existing tools that would meet those needs
