## Project overview

* Coding to Learn and Create is a joint project of the Inclusive Design Research Centre (IDRC) at OCAD University and Bridges Canada. The project was awarded a grant of $1.7 million dollars by the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, from the Accessible Technology Program.
* The Coding to Learn and Create is developing an inclusive coding environment and an open educational resource repository in collaboration with educators, students, and their families.
* Context:

  * Learning to code is increasingly part of the required curriculum in Canadian schools. Coding education is now mandatory in three provinces, and an encouraged part of the curriculum in most others.
  * Coding education can not only develop skills for future employment and career opportunities – “Learning to Code” But particularly for students with cognitive, communication and physical challenges, coding education can help develop social, daily living, and creative skills – “Coding to Learn.”
  * However, most popular programming environments are visual and incompatible with commonly-used assistive technologies (AT) and alternative input tools such as switches, onscreen keyboards, eye gaze systems, text-to-speech, and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC).
  * For students with cognitive and learning disabilities, coding can help teach crucial collaborative and communication skills, strategies for problem-solving, task sequencing, spatial awareness, and metacognitive skills. Thus, participation in coding activities can be a strong reinforcer of equality in the school community.
* Our Partners:

  * [Bridges Canada](https://www.bridges-canada.com/) is the only cross-Canada, full service, assistive technology company, delivering support in assistive technology for learning, communication, alternative access, low vision and blindness needs.
* Desired outcome:

  * Maybe the desired outcome is: - building an inclusive and accessible coding environment that empowers all learners to be creators of their digital worlds, to express themselves using code and art, and to apply these skills to other areas of learning and daily life.

## Co-design overview
### Goals:

  * Integrate the students' ideas into the design of the prototype early on as the project is being developed.
  * Partner with educators, students, and their families to develop a new inclusive coding environment scaffolded and customizable for students who have different physical, learning, and cognitive needs.
  * Create open resources for teachers that adapt coding curricula and make programming environments inclusive and adaptable to the diverse needs of all students.
* Participants:

  * Students with complex learning needs and learning differences
  * The participants' families
  * Special education teachers

### Outcomes:

  Refined the coding environment based on:

  * Direct feedback and recommendations from the students, their families and special education teachers
  * Observational notes throughout the co-design sessions that helped to identify the pain-points, gaps, and moments of delight as students with complex learning needs were using the coding environment

## Co-design process

To work with a broad range of learners and their educators, we worked with them in different contexts and applied different strategies to engage our co-designers in the process of learning about our coding environment and working with them to make it more accessible and fun. Although this work is ongoing, here are a few different examples of how we have applied co-design so far.

**NOTE:** The activities below occurred at different times in various places. So we created different activity pathways that could be used simultaneously or in random order rather than have activities done in sequential order.

### Activity: Summer coding camps for kids with diverse abilities

* We had 5 coding camps in the summer of 2019. At each of these camps, our team members worked with kids with different abilities and from different age groups over five days.
* During the first four days, the campers had a chance to work with different robots to learn basic coding concepts, such as categorization, sequences, parameters, and repeated patterns.
* On the last day of their coding camp, campers were introduced to the C2LC prototype. They had an opportunity to use the C2LC prototype to do various creative activities, such as drawing and painting.
* Once campers had an opportunity to trial the prototype and test its different aspects, they were involved in a co-design activity to generate ideas about how to improve the prototype to better address their needs.
* To learn more about the activities and results from each camp, please visit our camp blog posts on the[Coding to Learn and Create website](https://www.codelearncreate.org/blog/).

### Activity: Facilitated co-design workshops

* At different phases of the project, IDRC team is holding small to medium size co-design workshops in order to bring together the intended user groups. During these workshops, participants work on specific topics related to the project.
* In-person sessions take about 3-6 hours and remote workshops are about 1-2 hours. We often have 10-15 people participating in the workshops and 3-5 project team members facilitate the activities and support the participants.
* The activities for each of these workshops are collaboratively planned with Bridges and other partner educators and advisors to ensure they are suitable for the participants.

### Activity: Embedded co-design workshops at schools

* IDRC and Bridges identified different organizations, schools, and institutions across Canada to invite them to participate in an embedded co-design process.
* The project team worked with the interested organizations to plan activities that are appropriate for their context, members and available resources.
* These sessions were conducted in the presence of facilitators from the project team as well as internal facilitators from the partner organization, such as teachers, assistants, and therapists.
* After each session, the project team met with the internal facilitators to get their insight from the session and planned the activities for the following sessions.

### Activity: Embedded virtual coding sessions

* Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we stopped our in-person workshops. To continue our embedded co-design activities during the quarantine, we planned a series of online coding sessions with the students from the same school we conducted our embedded co-design workshops with.
* We used Zoom for these sessions and invited students' teachers to join the sessions and participate in the planning process for each activity.
* Each session was 30 min to 1 hour.
* The main goal of each session was to try out new coding activities and get feedback on our work in progress, while also giving learners, their teachers, and parents a break from the routine of daily online classes.

  * To learn more about embedded virtual co-design sessions visit our[Embedded co-design workshops posts](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/C2LC/Coding+to+Learn+and+Create+Co-Design+Kit)on the Fluid wiki.
* Virtual activities will take the place of our in-person co-design efforts until it is safe to resume them.

## Challenges and Learnings

Here are some common challenges and learnings that our team experienced across different co-design activities and contexts:

* Having concrete examples and models enabled students with complex learning needs to more fully participate in the planned activities.
* Abstract design thinking activities and open-ended questions, such as brainstorming or sketching new ideas were not effective and sometimes impeded participation. These activities are better coupled with hands-on and interactive tasks to keep participants engaged in those activities.
* 1:1 facilitation was required to maintain the participants’ focus, attention, and have discussions around their ideas that were not always articulated very clearly as a result of varying literacy levels and communication skills.
* Learners had a tendency to become disengaged from a task during longer activities. So activities that were under 10-15 minutes worked better than the longer ones.
* Including participants favorite topics and components in the activities helped maintain their engagement in the activity.
* Repetition and establishing a routine was the key to success of each of these activities. Starting with a circle time, reviewing the session's agenda, and concluding at the end keep gave them a sense of order and helped them build the right expectations.

## Recommendations

* When co-designing with children and individuals with complex learning needs:

  * It is helpful to approach them with a simple prototype. This gives them a concrete starting point and you are able to observe their interactions and begin a simplified co-creation process.
  * Avoid abstract exercises and start with simple questions and concrete examples. Whenever possible, model the activities for them to help them understand the goals and the steps of an activity.
  * For participants who have difficulty communicating their choices, provide simple options that they can choose from.
  * Limit the sensory stimulation, and the number of tasks and the number of goals they have to achieve at each session to keep the participants focus on the planned activities
  * Short sessions with a clear agenda help students to remain engaged throughout the session

## Impact

* Through these co-design activities, we have been able to build a community of learners, educators, and activists who are interested in making coding accessible for kids with diverse needs.
* Based on the input we gathered from co-design sessions, we have been able to modify our design and make sure every aspect of our coding environment was accessible and multi-modal.
* Kids who participated in our co-design activities have developed skills that can help them both for coding and life in general, such as learning about directions, the ability to sort items, recognizing repeated patterns, putting items in order, and planning and building a sequence of actions.
* QUOTE:

  * "Learning to code empowers students to be active producers of their digital environments, not just consumers of apps and games. And through coding to learn they develop skills in planning, acquire perseverance in problem-solving, and discover new personal outlets for communication, participation, and creative expression," said Susie Blackstien-Adler, Bridges’ Professional Learning Manager and C2LC Project Lead

## Next steps

* The C2LC project is a work in progress and the final coding environment will be disseminated in March 2022.
* Our team will continue the co-design efforts and hold a variety of facilitated and embedded workshops to finalize the features and functionalities that are needed to make this environment accessible, inclusive, and fun to use.
* Our team will also engage our co-designers, educators, and accessibility specialists as expert critics to try the coding environment at different stages and provide feedback about their experience with this web-based coding environment.
* We are also building an open repository of learning tools and activities based on our ongoing co-design activities. This open repository aims to help learners either at home or school to develop the foundational skills for coding and start using any block-based coding environment, such as the C2LC "inclusive design coding environment" to build different programs.
