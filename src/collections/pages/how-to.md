## Goal of this kit

The goal of the Community-Led Co-design Kit is to provide an open toolkit for sharing knowledge about how to do
co-design that is led by community members and organizations, and to share how this process contributes to the creation
of more inclusive designs.

## Who this kit is for

**Everyone is welcome to use and contribute to this kit.**

We especially welcome those who:

* **Don't have "design" in their job title.** The co-design process can benefit anyone who designs or is impacted by
design, which is to say, everyone.
* **Are a part of a community organization or movement.** You may be curious about what design entails and how it can be
used to create a more intentional and inclusive planning process for anything you're working on - whether it be a
program, a process, or a website.
* **Are designers who want change.** You want to critically question the assumptions and methods of design, and want to
intentionally develop your practice in ways that prioritize inclusivity and equity.

## What's in the kit

The kit contains the following types of resources:

* **Guides** - these include considerations and suggested practices for specific topics, such as facilitation, remote
co-design, or accessibility.
* **Activities** - these provide more detailed suggested practices that contribute to making co-design more inclusive.
They include things like planning your co-design activities, ensuring accessibility for your co-designers, and
identifying your community facilitators.
* **Tools** - these are adaptable templates or documents that you can use and adapt in your co-design process. For
example, a tool can be a letter template for recruiting co-designers, or a table you can fill out to generate design
ideas.
* **Case studies** - these provide examples of the different ways that community-led co-design can be practiced, based
on specific design projects. The approach can look dramatically different depending on the context of your project,
collaborators, and community.

## How the kit is organized

The resources in this kit are loosely organized around the following **building blocks of co-design**:

* **Partnerships** - the resources under this building block can help you to find the people youâ€™d like to collaborate
with, who are active participants in their community. You create the project together: what the project is about, what
your collective goals and priorities are, and what the scope is.
* **Community involvement** - resources found here will help you to bring members of the community you're working with
into the co-design process. Community members can participate in many ways, including but not limited to: planning the
co-design process, facilitating the co-design sessions, or being a participant in the sessions.
* **Co-design planning** - these resources can help you plan all that is needed for the co-design engagement, including
activities, logistics, meeting accessibility needs, scheduling, and more.
* **Facilitation** - these resources can help you to create the environment and conditions for participants to be able
to fully contribute, and to support community leaders in doing so themselves.
* **Ideas and outcomes** - resources found here relate to capturing and working with the ideas and outcomes that emerge
from the co-design sessions, including how to document and synthesize them, and how to address questions such as
attribution.
* **Reflections** - these resources will help you take the time to reflect on the co-design process including what went
well and what could be improved for next time.

## Where to begin

* **Read the introduction first.** To get a sense of what we mean by co-design and community-led co-design, consider
reading the [Introduction to Community-led co-design](/introduction/) document first. This document provides a more
detailed description of our unique definition of and approach to co-design.
* **Browse by building block.** If there is a particular aspect of co-design that you're interested in learning more
about, you can start there.
* **Browse by community collections (TBD).** We've asked some of our community members to put together collections of
kit resources that they have found most useful. These include collections for:
  * Beginners - those new to co-design
  * Designers and researchers
  * Community organizations
