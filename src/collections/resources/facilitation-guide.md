## What

A facilitation template outlines the details and order of the co-design activities for facilitatorsâ€™ reference during the session. It can contain the following information for each activity:

* Name
* Goal
* How long it takes
* Format - e.g. individual activity, small group activity, or with the whole group.
* Step by step instructions
* Materials and tools needed
* Arrangement of the physical space
* Links to any online documents or templates
* Any extra instructions or tips to support facilitators

## Why

### Keep track of all the moving parts during the session

Co-design sessions can be chaotic with a lot of things happening at once. It can be helpful for all facilitators to have one central document that contains all the details of the session.

### Structure for planning

Co-design welcomes contributions to planning and facilitation by anyone who wishes to take part, whether they have previous experience or not. The template linked below provides a structure to help facilitators develop their own activities and consider all the details. This template can also help with planning your co-design sessions.
