## What

Recruiting participants is an important step in the co-design planning process. This is most effective when communities and organizations take the lead and recruit co-designers from their community.

## Why

Centering the perspectives of those most affected by the design is a core value for co-design. It is important to recruit co-designers who are often considered to be "edge cases". This would include those who have challenges with how the current system or design works, or can't use it altogether.

## When

The effort and time it takes to recruit participants is often underestimated, especially if you are looking to recruit co-designers with a wide range of needs. We recommend starting the recruitment process as early as possible in your co-design process.

It is also important to note that co-designers will have different accessibility needs. As a result it is best if you start planning the logistics of the event at the same time as you are recruiting participants.

## How

### To recruit

Reaching out to community members or community leaders is a good first step in the recruitment process. Use methods that are most comfortable or preferable to them.

Here are a few different ways to reach people where they are:

* phone calls or text messages
* emails
* social media
* joining town hall meetings
* at community centers
* posting a note on library bulletin boards.

If people raise any issues about accessibility or other concerns when you are speaking with them, take a note of them for your planning process.

### Suggested content to include in recruitment communication

Check out the [sample recruitment letter](/resources/Recruitment-Letter/)for information to put in the recruitment communication. You can also put out a simple recruitment invite, graphic, or social media call-out to inform people of your plans. Once community members express interest, you can provide more details.

### To support recruitment

Collaborators (designers or others) can support community organizations and leaders in recruiting by providing:

* Recruitment letters, graphics, or social media call-outs
* Detailed recruitment information (e.g. [sample recruitment letter](/resources/Recruitment-Letter))
* Any [consent forms required](/resources/Consent-Forms-and-Policies/)
