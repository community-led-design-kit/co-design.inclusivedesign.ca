## What
A design brief is a report that helps bring clarity, direction, and scope to a
project and its goals by presenting ideas and concepts that emerge from
collaborative design activities and other inclusive design practices.

A design brief can contain:
* explanations of methodologies
* design and development recommendations
* considerations for further short term and long term explorations

Design briefs can be used as a communication tool to help stakeholders and other
interested parties understand the issues and needs of the community they are
working with, and possible approaches to address them.

## Why
The purpose of the design brief is to provide direction for continued co-design
work at any stage in the project when the design may not yet be fully realized,
but some co-design activities have been completed. It can also help  enhance
clarity and define scope by summarizing the outcomes synthesized from co-design
activities so far, and by providing specific actionable recommendations,
suggestions, and ideas. Over the course of a project, multiple design briefs can
be created.

## When
A design brief can be created whenever a meaningful milestone has been reached
and there is a desire to share the design journey up to that point  (read more
in [Design Process](/design-process)).

## Things to consider

### Aid understanding
The design brief can include contextual information to support the intended
audience in better understanding the co-design outcomes and suggested
approaches. This may require providing detail about the issues being addressed,
the co-design process, and/or methods used to synthesize or prioritize design
ideas.

For example, if a particular collaborative design process or activity was used,
it may be useful to describe that process or activity in detail in order to
support a better understanding of the co-designed outcomes that came from it.

### Preserve and respect diversity
The process of creating a design brief likely requires combining and summarizing
diverse findings to allow others to understand, at a high level, the work that
has been done. This process may result in generalized or abstracted ideas which
can lead to a loss of unique voices and perspectives, which in turn can lead to
a lost opportunity for innovation.

Design, Part
One](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/ideas/the-three-dimensions-of-inclusive-design-part-one/).


The following are some strategies to help maintain diverse voices and
contributions:
* When generalizations or abstractions are made, acknowledge that these may not
  capture all contributions by all participants.
* Balance generalizations with examples of individual contributions throughout
  the design brief.
* Give examples of contributions that do not fit neatly into a generalization
  and explain why those contributions may be interesting or significant.
* Include an appendix or refer to a source where all individual contributions
  can be accessed.

### Embrace Lack of Completeness
Emphasize that the design brief represents a culmination of what is understood
_so far_ and that there is more exploration and refinement to be done.

This can be done by:
* Documenting the lack of completeness where necessary. For example, synthesized
  findings may highlight a particular response by participants that may not be
  fully understood and may be worth further exploration. 
* Including a section about possible future directions for further co-design and
  promising untapped ideas.
* Using indefinite language such as “good practices” instead of “best
  practices”, and “approaches” instead of “solutions”. This helps to reinforce
  the idea that understanding of the topic will continue to grow and change.

## Contents of a design brief
The contents of a design brief can vary depending on the audience, project
stage, and other factors. A design brief can include:

* A summary of the design process taken so far which can include how
  co-designers were selected, details about workshop structure, and co-design
  tools and processes used at these events.
* Findings that have emerged from the design process. This can include any
  synthesis and interesting themes. 
* Presentation and discussion of concepts and ideas including design mockups,
  prototypes, or other artifacts. 
* Direction and suggestions for future design and development based on co-design
findings and artifacts. Possible plans for future exploration.

A project may have multiple design briefs created at different milestones and
can show the evolution and refinement of ideas, concepts, and artifacts over
time - giving further clarity, direction, and scope.
