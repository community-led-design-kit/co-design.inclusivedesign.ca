## What
A design brief is a report that helps bring clarity and scope to a project and
its goals by drawing upon ideas and concepts from collaborative design
activities and other inclusive design practices.

A design brief can contain:
* explanations of methodologies
* design and development recommendations
* considerations for future short term and long term directions

Design briefs can be used as a communication tool to help stakeholders and other
interested parties understand issues and needs, and possible approaches to
address them.

## Why
The purpose of a design brief is to help enhance clarity and define scope by
summarizing the outcomes synthesized from co-design activities so far (see
[Synthesizing Co-design Outcomes](/resources/synthesizing-co-design-outcomes)
and [Co-designing Synthesis](/resources/co-designing-synthesis)), and by
providing specific actionable recommendations, suggestions, and ideas.

## When
A design brief can be created when co-design activities have been synthesized
and interesting concepts are coalescing into more formed ideas and designs (see:
[The design process: Map and walking guide](/design-process)).

## Things to consider

### Aid understanding
The design brief should contain enough contextual information for the intended
audience. This may require providing additional detail about the issues,
process, or methodology so the presented ideas and possible approaches are more
fully understood.

For example, if a particular collaborative design process was used, it may be
useful to detail that design process to better understand the co-designed
solutions that came from it.

### Preserve and respect diversity
The process of creating a design brief likely requires combining and summarizing
diverse findings to allow others to understand, at a high level, the work that
has been done. This process may result in generalized or abstracted details
which can lead to a loss of unique voices and perspectives that can lead to a
loss of innovation (see: [The Three Dimensions of Inclusive Design, Part One](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/ideas/the-three-dimensions-of-inclusive-design-part-one/)).

Some strategies to help maintain the diverse voices and contributions:
* When generalizations or abstractions are made, acknowledge that it does not
  capture all contributions by participants.
* Balance generalizations with specific examples of contributions or findings
  throughout the content of the design brief.
* Give examples of contributions that do not fit neatly under a generalization
  and explain why those contributions may be interesting or significant.
* Include in an appendix or include reference to a source to access all
  contributions.

### Embrace Lack of Completeness
Maintain an expectation that a design brief represents a culmination of what is
understood _so far_ and that there is more exploration and refinement to be
done.

This can be done by:
* Documenting the lack of completeness where necessary. For example, synthesis
  findings may highlight a particular response by participants, but it may not
  be fully understood why they responded that way.
* Including a section about possible future directions and promising untapped
  ideas from co-design.
* Using indefinite language such as “good practices” instead of “best
  practices”, and “approaches” instead of “solutions” which helps reinforce the
  idea that understanding of the topic will continue to grow and change.

## Contents of a design brief
The contents of a design brief can vary depending on the audience, project
stage, and other factors. A design brief can include:

* Summary of the design process taken so far which can include how co-designers
  were gathered, details about workshops, and co-design tools and processes used
  at these events.
* Findings that have been emerging from the design process. This can include any
  synthesis (see: [Synthesizing Co-design Outcomes](/resources/synthesizing-co-design-outcomes)) and interesting
  themes.
* Discussion of concepts and ideas including design mockups, prototypes, or
  other artifacts.
* Direction and suggestions for design and development based on co-design
  findings and artifacts.
* Possible plans for the future exploration and discovery drawn from findings
  and synthesis.
