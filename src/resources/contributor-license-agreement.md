## What

A contributor license agreement (CLA) outlines the terms of an individual’s participation and the ownership of his/her contributions. The language of the CLA should be easily understandable and avoid technical and legal terms. It should be provided in alternative formats in advance of a collaborative activity to allow all participants enough time and resources to access and understand its content.

## Why

To be able to participate in a collaborative activity, each contributor needs to sign a CLA to indicate agreement to the provided license terms. Individuals who choose to not sign a CLA won’t be able to participate in a collaborative activity, as each participant's permission is required in order to openly license the group contributions.
