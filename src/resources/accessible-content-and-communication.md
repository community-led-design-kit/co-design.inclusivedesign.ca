## About this guide

So much of our communication happens through technology. It's important to make sure that all content shared with participants is accessible. By doing so you'll help to ensure that everyone can get the information they need to fully participate in your co-design session.

This guide includes a list of resources that describe how to make various media accessible, ranging from PowerPoint slide decks to videos.

Detailed accessibility information about the event, the space, the agenda, the location and any specific arrangements can be documented in an [Access Guide](/resources/Access-Guide).  

## How-to

### Practices

#### Using multiple formats
Ideas can be communicated in many different formats, and providing any co-design related content in multiple formats helps to ensure that everyone can access it. 

Creating a prompt for you co-design session to introduce participants to the activities you will be doing, or to present any preparatory work you would like them to do, is a great way to engage your co-designers. For many however, large amounts of text can be difficult to digest, so creating an audio and/or a captioned video prompt in addition to any text content can be a great way to ensure that everyone can engage with your content.
