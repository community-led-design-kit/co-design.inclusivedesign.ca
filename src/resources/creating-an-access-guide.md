The following content is based on the [Inclusive Cities Co-design Toolkit "Access Guide" resource page](https://cities.inclusivedesign.ca/resources/access-guide/).

## What

An access guide is an effective way to introduce people to an event they are invited to participate in. It contains detailed information about the event, the venue, the agenda, the location and any specific accessibility accommodations that have been arranged. An access guide can also include images of the venue (inside and out) and/or of the participants, as well as a map of the venue and directions on how to get to it. The images and map can help orient participants ahead of time to the location or to the people who will be present.

## Why

Although the creation of an access guide requires considerable time and resources, it is a worthwhile effort. It will make your event more accessible and inclusive by making it easier to get to. It helps participants know what to expect and can reduce anxiety and stress levels for participants attending an event in an unfamiliar environment. Once created, it can be reused for various events held at the same venue. 

## How

### Template
