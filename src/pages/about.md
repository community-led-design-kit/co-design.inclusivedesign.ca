## About this kit

The Community-led Co-design Kit is an initiative out of the [Inclusive Design Research Centre](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/) in Toronto, Canada. The project is funded by the [Hewlett Foundation](https://hewlett.org/), for the [Flexible Learning Open Education project](https://floeproject.org/). This is our first iteration of this kit, with many more things we'd like to add down the road.

## Making this kit

The learnings and insights in this kit have grown out of our experiences working with communities on projects such as [Co-designing Inclusive Cities](https://cities.inclusivedesign.ca/), [Platform Co-op Development Kit](https://platform.coop/), and [Coding to Learn and Create](https://www.codelearncreate.org/). In addition our own projects, our ideas were also inspired by practitioners and advocates of disability justice, anti-oppression movements, and decolonialist research and design methodologies.

We were fortunate enough to have many people in our community share their feedback with us. While we weren't able to address all of them this first version, we will be working our way through them in future versions. [See the to-do's based on their feedback.](/9977b0e62a104b148028b2272c049edf?v=1d8fe21d5a494c37a67860c8a1995379)
