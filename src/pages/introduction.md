## What is co-design?

Co-design is a process of “designing with”, rather than “designing for”. Those who are most impacted by the design, especially those with layered and complex needs, are involved in the design process from its earliest stages, are engaged throughout the process, and directly contribute to the creation of solutions that meet their unique needs. Participants are not involved as research subjects or consultants, rather as designers engaged in active and sustained collaboration.

Co-design can be undertaken at any stage of the design, and it encourages and makes space for a non-linear approach. The diagram below describes what co-design can look like at different stages of the design process and shows how one might take a non-linear path through those stages. No matter where you are beginning, or where you want to go, you can use co-design to make your design process more inclusive.

## Why do co-design?

### Current state

#### Empathy is not enough

In some design practices, various methods are used to stand in for participation of marginalized communities. For example, "empathy exercises" are employed in an attempt to help designers empathize with those they are designing for, where designers might use a wheelchair for a week to understand what it's like to have mobility differences or sleep in a shelter to understand the experience of the unhoused. These exercises are very limited however in that the do not take into account the experience a lifetime of facing the barriers and systemic discrimination of ableism, or the lack of supports or safety net for those with a mental illness that may have led to being unhoused. Empathizing with our users is not enough, we must include people with lived experience in the design process.

#### Needs of those on the margins are relegated to 'edge cases'

When researchers and designers are analyzing the results of their research, they often look for broad and overarching user needs. The needs that don't fit in are often seen as "edge cases" or outliers, and as a result these needs are often not addressed with the justification that only a small proportion of the research population has them. However, when scaled up, these so-called outliers represent a huge number of people who will not be able to use the design. In addition, designing to meet the needs of marginalized groups often results in the needs of those in the center being met as well, and is where exciting design innovations take place.

#### Human-centred design research doesn't include accountability

Designers and researchers using a traditional design process often have no accountability to the communities they research. In some cases, once the research is done, participants never hear from researchers and designers again, even though the outcome of their research can deeply impact the participants' everyday lives. This lack of accountability to the community can create distrust, with communities being used as extractive resources while not experiencing any beneficial change.

#### Research has the power to marginalize communities

For many communities who have been pushed to the edges of society, research has often played an active part in that marginalization. As Eve Tuck writes in her paper with K Yang "R-Words: Refusing Research": "Research is a dirty word among many Native communities (Tuhiwai Smith 1999), and arguably, also among ghettoized (Kelley, 1997), Orientalized (Said, 1978), and other communities of overstudied Others."

**Examples include:**

* In the 1940's and 50's, the American Government went to Unangax homes every month to collect a vial of blood from family members without permission (Decolonizing Methodologies 15 years later, Eve Tuck).
* Henrietta Lacks' cells were taken without permission from or awareness of her or her family. Her cells live on as HeLa cells, which have been used to develop the polio vaccine, numerous cancer treatments, and have been sold for incalculable profit - while her family still cannot afford health insurance (The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Rebecca Skloot).
* The Moynihan Report, published in 1965, blamed female-headed households for the breaking down of Black American family structure. This report shifted blame away from systemic inequalities onto those who suffered these oppressions instead ([The Moynihan Report at Fifty, Stephen Steinberg](https://bostonreview.net/us/stephen-steinberg-moynihan-report-black-families-nathan-glazer)).

### Co-design as an approach

#### Lived experience as expertise

People who are most impacted by designs, have difficulty using a design, or cannot use a design are often those who have innovative ideas about making a design more accessible and inclusive. They know exactly what works and doesn't work about a design, and have often already created hacks and workarounds to overcome barriers. A co-design approach values the lived experiences of people as expertise, respecting and learning from their knowledge throughout the design process.

#### Start with broad needs

When people with complex and layered needs design with you, the designs are more likely to cover a broad range of needs and considerations. If a design works well for a broad set of needs, arguably mainstream users' needs will also be met. A co-design approach aims to centre the design process around complex needs in this way.

#### Acknowledging the role of research in marginalization

For communities who have been harmed by research and the traditional and opposing roles of researcher / research subject, co-design offers an alternative. It strives to bring these power dynamics to light, transfer decision-making power, build in accountability measures, and design alongside, rather than prescribing solutions from the outside.

## What is community-led co-design?

Community-led co-design is an approach in which the co-design process,**not just the outcome**, is developed in collaboration with community members who will be directly impacted by the design. It leverages existing leadership within those communities, by identifying and collaborating with members who will take on the role of facilitation of the co-design sessions.

The partnership with communities can take different forms on a spectrum from project designers working collaboratively with community members to develop the building blocks of the co-design process, up to the point where leadership comes entirely from the community itself.

The diagram below lays out what the different building blocks of co-design can look like, along this spectrum:

## Why community-led co-design?

### Recognizes and leverages community leadership

By recognizing and leveraging existing leadership in a community, the process and facilitation will be more contextually appropriate, comfortable, and familiar to the community members. Outside designers without similar lived experience will not have the same contextual knowledge or trust of the community. Leveraging community leadership enables the participation of community members and ensures their contributions in a way that might not be made possible otherwise.

### Uses a familiar and comfortable environment

Community-led co-design takes place in the community, in an environment and with people who are already familiar with each other. This is one of the greatest strengths of the community-led co-design approach, as it reduces the burden of adapting to a new environment and new people, and allows co-designers to focus on the design process itself.

### Creates more engaged communities

The more stake communities have in deciding on the design process from the beginning, rather than having a prescriptive process imposed on them, the more likely they will be engaged in that process in a committed and sustainable way. This contributes to a greater likelihood that the designs will address their needs and desires.

### Moves from design *with* to design *by*

Ultimately, community-led co-design moves toward ["by us, for us", ](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/0229acaa-f692-41c9-b547-7679948a82b6/All_About_Us_-_Indigneous_Data_Analysis_Workshop.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200929%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20200929T195227Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=714bfaf0f418fde513146288d3f3d58fcd0296aef6af83c4f56dc828364735f3&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22All%2520About%2520Us%2520-%2520Indigneous%2520Data%2520Analysis%2520Workshop.pdf%22)in which designs are created*by*community members, rather than*for*them, or even*with*them. This emphasizes the importance and the value of self-determination, moving us toward a future where the imbalance and separation of researcher / subject is eliminated.
