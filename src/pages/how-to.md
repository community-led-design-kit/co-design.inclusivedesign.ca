## Goal of this kit

The goal of this Community-Led Co-design Kit is to provide an open source toolkit for sharing knowledge about how to do co-design led by community members and organizations, and why it matters to creating more inclusive designs. 

## Who is this kit for

**Everyone is welcome to use and contribute to this kit.**

We especially welcome those who:

- **Don't have "design" in their job title.** While the design profession tends to recognize only  individuals with credentials, we believe that _"all people are designers... Design is the conscious effort to impose a meaningful order.",_ to quote Victor Papanek. The co-design process can benefit anyone who designs, which is to say, everyone.
- **Are a part of a community organization or movement.** You may be curious about what design entails and how it can be used to create a more intentional and inclusive planning process for anything you're working on - whether it be a program, a process, or a website.
- **Are a designer who wants change.** You want to critically question the methods that the design industry has inherited, or want to intentionally develop your practice in ways that prioritize inclusivity and equity.

## What's in here

### Guides

Guides include considerations and suggested practices for specific topics, such as facilitation, remote co-design, or accessibility.

### Activities

Activities are suggested tasks that contribute to making co-design happen. They include things like planning your co-design activities, ensuring accessibility for your co-designers, and identifying your community facilitators. 

### Tools

Tools are adaptable templates or documents to use in your co-design process. For example, a tool can be a letter template for recruiting co-designers. 

### Case studies

Case studies showcase all the different ways community-led co-design can be practiced, as this approach can look dramatically different depending on the context of your project, collaborators, and community.

## How the kit is organized

You'll see that this kit is roughly organized based on the **different building blocks essential to putting together a co-design**. Here's a description of each building block:

### Partnerships

Finding the people who you're interested in collaborating with, who are active participants in their community. You form the project together: What the project is about, what your collective goals and priorities are, and what the scope is.

### Community involvement

Involving members of the community you're working with in the co-design process. Community members can participate in many ways, including but not limited to: Planning the co-design process, facilitating the co-design sessions, or being a participant in the sessions.

### Co-design plan

Planning all that is needed for the co-design engagement to get off the ground. For example - activities, logistics, accessibility, schedules, and more.

### Facilitation

Creating the environment and conditions for your co-designers to be able to participate and contribute.

### Ideas and outcomes

Ideas and outcomes that result from the co-design sessions: How to document it, synthesize it, and also larger questions such as who owns these ideas. 

### Reflections

This building block is about taking the time to reflect on the process on what has gone well and what could be improved for next time.

## How to use this kit

### Read the introduction first

To get a sense of what we mean by co-design and community-led co-design, consider reading [this introduction](/introduction/) first. Even if you already know what these things mean for your practice, our understandings may vary. This will explain where we're coming from when we initially put this kit together.

### Browse by building block

### Browse by community reading list

We've asked some of our community members to put together a reading list for us, based on what's helped them the most.
